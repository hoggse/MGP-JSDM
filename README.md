# MGP-JSDM
Multivariate Gaussian Process Model for Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDMs)


This software implements a separable, multivariate Gaussian process to both  simulate correlated multi-species data and to fit a Bayesian regression model using the greta package.  To run this software you must install the greta package.  This MGP model allows both spatial and inter-species correlations to be modelled.
